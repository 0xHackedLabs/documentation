# 0xHacked

Welcome to [0xHacked](https://0xHacked.com)!

[0xHacked](https://0xHacked.com) is a trustless war room for whitehats, where the white hat can submit the proof of exploit to claim a bug bounty without disclosing details through the zero-knowledge proof. We aspire to safeguard the interests of white hats and ensure they receive a deserved reward for their findings and efforts. Furthermore, we aim to transform the relationship between hackers and projects by fostering dialogue rather than destruction. We hope you have an enjoyable experience at [0xHacked](https://0xHacked.com).

Enjoy Hacking!

Before we start, there are a few reminders that merit attention. You don't need to drain the entire contract when providing proof of the vulnerability's existence. To expedite the process, please simplify the code and logic; for example, minimal disruption will suffice concerning reentrancy attacks. If you need a flash loan, utilize the deal (`zkProver evm -h`) function to supplement the necessary ETH to your address.

## Quickstart
### 1. prepare the PoC

``` solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;

contract Exploit {
    // constructor functions aren't supported.
    // constructor() {
    //     won't work here.
    // }
    function exploit() public {
    }
}
```

Here are some [PoC demos](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/PoC) for your reference.

### 2. generate the proof

After debugging this exploit contract using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), you can generate the proof of exploit on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/0xHacked/zkProver) online or follow the commands below to do it locally:

``` bash
zkProver evm Exploit.sol:Exploit -b BLOCK_NUMBER -r https://rpc.flashbots.net/

# use -d to set the balance of your PoC contract
zkProver evm Exploit.sol:Exploit -b BLOCK_NUMBER -r https://rpc.flashbots.net/ -d 10000ethers -d 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7:100000gwei
```

If you haven't installed zkProver, please visit [zkProver repository](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/zkProver).

### 3. upload the proof

Upload your proof binary file to [0xHacked](https://0xHacked.com). The sample proof file can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/documentation/blob/main/attachment/SushiRouter.proof.bin). We'll check the token balance change and state diff once uploaded and confirm the exploit asap.
