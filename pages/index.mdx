# 0xHacked

[0xHacked](https://0xHacked.com) is a post-audit security protocol that enables war rooms for whitehats, where the white hat can submit the proof of exploit to claim a bug bounty without disclosing details through ZKP.

Please feel free to contact me via [Telegram](https://t.me/dimitrysc) if you have any questions or encounter any errors.

Enjoy Hacking!

## Quickstart
### 1. prepare the PoC

``` solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;

// This `Exploit` contract is a must-have. zkProver invokes Exploit contract by default.
contract Exploit {
    // constructor functions aren't supported.
    // constructor() {
    //    code here doesn't work.
    // }

    function exploit() public {
    }
}
```

Here are some [PoC demos](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/PoC) for your reference.

### 2. generate the proof

After debugging this exploit contract using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), you can generate the proof of exploit on [0xHacked Online Tool](https://www.0xhacked.com/tool) or follow the commands below to do it locally.
0xHacked also supports flash loans, we stay the same as https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std/deal. See `zkProver evm -h` for more details.

``` bash
zkProver evm Exploit.sol -b BLOCK_NUMBER -r https://rpc.flashbots.net/

# use -d to set the balance of your PoC contract
zkProver evm Exploit.sol -b BLOCK_NUMBER -r https://rpc.flashbots.net/ -d 10000ethers -d 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7:100000gwei
```

If you haven't installed zkProver, please visit [zkProver repository](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/zkProver).

### 3. upload the proof

Upload your proof binary file to [0xHacked](https://0xHacked.com). The sample proof file can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/documentation/blob/main/attachment/SushiRouter.proof.bin). We'll check the token balance change and state diff once uploaded and confirm the exploit asap.
